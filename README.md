# Advanced-EDA-for-Genomic-Data-Analysis-Identifying-Genetic-Variations-Through-Visualization
This phase of the "Advanced EDA for Genomic Data Analysis" project centered on building and 
evaluating predictive models. Following extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and 
visualization to identify patterns and genetic variations within the genomic data, the focus 
shifted to selecting appropriate machine learning algorithms. These algorithms were then trained 
using the processed data, and their performance was rigorously evaluated. The project aimed to 
classify genetic sequences with both accuracy and robustness, ensuring reliable predictions on 
new data. To achieve this, various models were tested, and their performance was analyzed using 
a range of metrics, ultimately leading to optimized predictions. The ultimate goal of model 
training and evaluation was to accurately and robustly classify genetic sequences. "Accurate" 
means the models make correct predictions, while "robust" implies they perform well on new, 
unseen data and are not overly sensitive to minor variations in the data.
